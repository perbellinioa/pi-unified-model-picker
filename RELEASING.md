# Releasing

Releases are staged on npm by `.github/workflows/publish.yml` using GitHub OIDC trusted publishing, then approved manually with 2FA. Do not add an npm token to the repository.

## Prerequisites

- Start from an up-to-date `main` branch.
- The npm package's trusted publisher must point to `perbellinioa/pi-unified-model-picker` and `publish.yml`, with **stage publish** permission.
- Traditional npm tokens should remain disallowed for publishing.
- Node 22, Node 24, and CodeQL checks must pass.

## Prepare the release

Create a branch and choose the appropriate semantic version increment:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c release/v0.1.1
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
```

Use `minor` or `major` instead of `patch` when appropriate. Update the README, benchmarks, tests, goldens, and release notes for user-visible changes.

Validate exactly what will ship:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run validate
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
npm pack --dry-run
```

Commit, push, and open a pull request. Merge only after all required checks pass.

## Publish

After merging, confirm `main` contains the intended version:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
node --print "require('./package.json').version"
```

Create a GitHub release with a tag that exactly matches `v` plus the package version, for example `v0.1.1`. The release event triggers the trusted publisher workflow.

```bash
gh release create v0.1.1 \
  --repo perbellinioa/pi-unified-model-picker \
  --target main \
  --title v0.1.1 \
  --generate-notes
```

The workflow verifies the tag, installs without lifecycle scripts, runs validation, and executes:

```bash
npm stage publish --access public --provenance
```

## Review and approve

The staged package is not public until a maintainer approves it with 2FA. Inspect it before approval:

```bash
npm stage list pi-unified-model-picker
npm stage view <stage-id>
npm stage download <stage-id>
```

Approve a valid package:

```bash
npm stage approve <stage-id>
```

Reject an invalid package instead:

```bash
npm stage reject <stage-id>
```

The same review and approval actions are available in npmjs.com's **Staged Packages** tab.

## Verify

```bash
npm view pi-unified-model-picker version dist-tags dist.attestations --json
```

Then test an isolated pi installation or update the normal installation:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-unified-model-picker
# or, when already installed
pi update --extensions
```

Confirm `/model-picker` opens and the expected version appears on npm and the GitHub release page.

## Failure handling

npm versions are immutable and must never be overwritten.

- If staging fails, fix the issue through a pull request. Delete and recreate the GitHub release/tag only when the version is confirmed absent from both staged and published packages.
- If staged inspection fails, reject the stage and publish a corrected patch version; do not reuse the rejected version.
- If npm approval succeeded but later verification fails, publish a corrected patch version.
- Deprecate a broken version rather than attempting to reuse it.
